\title{Recursively compare two R objects for deep structural equality}
\arguments{
\item{obj1}{First object to compare - can be any R object (list, vector, primitive)}

\item{obj2}{Second object to compare - can be any R object (list, vector, primitive)}
}
\value{
Logical value: TRUE if objects are structurally and content-wise identical, FALSE otherwise
}
\description{
Recursively compare two R objects for deep structural equality
}
\details{
This static method performs deep comparison of R objects with special handling for:
\itemize{
\item Named lists (JSON objects): Compares all keys and recursively compares corresponding values
\item Unnamed lists (JSON arrays): Compares length and recursively compares elements by position
\item Primitive types: Returns TRUE if object classes match (assumes content equality for performance)
}
The comparison returns FALSE immediately if object classes don't match, enabling
fast rejection of obviously different objects.
